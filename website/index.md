title: "Driving E-Ink Displays"
---

## Objective
The Drivers for E-Ink displayâ€™s objective in the near term is to explore the different ways to drive an eink display, focusing on using a system on a chip with an integrated controller; i.MX7/8 and RK35663 family of microcontrollers. Evaluation kits and boards will be shared and distributed among group members. In the long-term, we are interested in building an open-source external electrophoretic display controller enabling higher performance processors and flexibility with the implementation of the waveforms with eink devices. The research from this group will support future/current working groups.

## Active Project
The current active project for the Drivers for E-ink Displays working group is the Archer and Casper prototype.
